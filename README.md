# COMSM0166 Project Template
A project template for the Software Engineering Discipline and Practice module (COMSM0166).

## Info

This is the template for your group project repo/report. We'll be setting up your repo and assigning you to it after the group forming activity. You can delete this info section, but please keep the rest of the repo structure intact.

You will be developing your game using [P5.js](https://p5js.org) a javascript library that provides you will all the tools you need to make your game. However, we won't be teaching you javascript, this is a chance for you and your team to learn a (friendly) new language and framework quickly, something you will almost certainly have to do with your summer project and in future. There is a lot of documentation online, you can start with:

- [P5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) 
- [Coding Train P5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js) course - go here for enthusiastic video tutorials from Dan Shiffman (recommended!)

## Your Game (change to title of your game)

STRAPLINE. Add an exciting one sentence description of your game here.

IMAGE. Add an image of your game here, keep this updated with a snapshot of your latest development.

LINK. Add a link here to your deployed game, you can also make the image above link to your game if you wish. Your game lives in the [/docs](/docs) folder, and is published using Github pages. 

VIDEO. Include a demo video of your game here (you don't have to wait until the end, you can insert a work in progress video)

Each player has 3 lives. | (1) Explosive Block Types<br>- Chain explosions, mini-bombs, unusual fire patterns<br><br>(2) Dynamic Maze<br>- Walls move, paths open, blocks regenerate<br><br>(3) Enemy AI Variations<br>- Enemies can kick, throw, or push bombs | (1) Fair random maze generation<br>(2) Ensuring dynamic changes don’t disrupt gameplay<br>(3) Balancing different explosion behaviors |
| Multiplayer / MOBA / Action Strategy | Honor of Kings | A 5v5 MOBA focused on team-based combat, hero roles, strategy, and mechanical skill. | (1) Dynamic map events<br>(2) In-match progression choices<br>(3) Team coordination mechanics<br>(4) Improved tutorials & role guidance<br>(5) Post-match performance feedback | (1) Game balance across heroes & items<br>(2) High learning curve for new players<br>(3) Network latency & server stability<br>(4) Matchmaking fairness |
| Macro Management / Multi-tasking / Tower Defense | Command & Conquer: Red Alert | Players build bases, manage resources, research technology, and command land, sea, and air forces to defeat enemies. | (1) Random storyline events (e.g. cold snaps)<br>(2) Dynamic vision & radar systems<br>(3) Destructible terrain & structures<br>(4) Neutral resource competition | (1) RNG balance issues<br>(2) Collision recalculation after terrain change<br>(3) Fixed enemy paths reduce replay difficulty |
| Puzzle Game / Puzzle Adventure | Rusty Lake, Cube Escape, Monument Valley | Puzzle progression driven by observation, rule learning, experimentation, and information synthesis. | (1) Non-linear clue discovery<br>(2) Consistent rules with fair misdirection | (1) Interaction system accuracy (click/drag)<br>(2) Debugging non-linear puzzle states<br>(3) Puzzle logic & save-state management |
| Tower Defense | Kingdom Rush, Plants vs. Zombies | Players place defensive structures to stop waves of enemies from reaching their base. | Add collectible temporary buffs dropped by monsters to increase strategic depth. | Balancing randomness with strategy, avoiding interruption and visual clutter |
| Puzzle Game / Match-3 | Candy Crush Saga | Players swap tiles to match three or more items to meet level objectives within limited moves. | Add obstacles (chocolate, ice, chains) requiring multiple matches to clear. | Ensuring solvable boards & non-repetitive patterns; smooth animations & particle effects |


###### Two Game Ideas

We have selected two game concepts for further development.

The first is a Minecraft-themed 2D platformer. We plan to leverage the iconic pixel art and classic mechanics of Minecraft—such as biome-hopping (from grasslands to deep caves), tool upgrades, and using items like water buckets and TNT—to create a familiar yet fresh exploration and survival experience.

Its major advantages are significantly reduced asset creation by utilizing MC's established visual style and high recognizability among UK audiences. Another key feature of the game is the use of randomly generated enemies, ensuring that each playthrough feels unpredictable. In addition, the game includes multiple environments—such as underground caves, and underwater areas—each with distinct gameplay mechanics and movement constraints.

The second is an environmental puzzle game centered on a core "time reversal" mechanic with platforms or maze maps. The player starts in a fully polluted city and must navigate through it, undo ecological damage by collecting various pollutants and healing affected wildlife. A character selection system with varied stats (e.g., healing vs. cleanup proficiency) influences multiple endings.

A key design feature is that the game encourages players to retrace their steps. During the final phase, players must return along the same path they previously traveled. However, the environment has changed due to their actions, causing new tools, routes, or interactions to appear. This allows players to evaluate whether their choices have successfully led to a cleaner, healthier city. While the theme is impactful and the rewind mechanic is innovative, the main challenges was the complexity of tracking and reversing player's states and the additional asset for branching narratives.

- Reflect on the project as a whole. Lessons learnt. Reflect on challenges. Future work, describe both immediate next steps for your current game and also what you would potentially do if you had chance to develop a sequel.

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which *may* be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Please let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent and we will do our best to help your team work harmoniously together.

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5% of report grade) 
  - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly available.
- **Documentation** of code (5% of report grade)
  - Organise your code so that it could easily be picked up by another team in the future and developed further.
  - Is your repo clearly organised? Is code well commented throughout?

# Two Game Ideas
We have selected two game concepts for further development. 

The first is a Minecraft-themed 2D platformer. We plan to leverage the iconic pixel art and classic mechanics of Minecraft—such as biome-hopping (from grasslands to deep caves), tool upgrades, and using items like water buckets and TNT—to create a familiar yet fresh exploration and survival experience. 

Its major advantages are significantly reduced asset creation by utilizing MC's established visual style and high recognizability among UK audiences. Another key feature of the game is the use of randomly generated enemies, ensuring that each playthrough feels unpredictable. In addition, the game includes multiple environments—such as underground caves, and underwater areas—each with distinct gameplay mechanics and movement constraints. 

The second is an environmental puzzle game centered on a core "time reversal" mechanic with platforms or maze maps. The player starts in a fully polluted city and must navigate through it, undo ecological damage by collecting various pollutants and healing affected wildlife. A character selection system with varied stats (e.g., healing vs. cleanup proficiency) influences multiple endings. 

A key design feature is that the game encourages players to retrace their steps. During the final phase, players must return along the same path they previously traveled. However, the environment has changed due to their actions, causing new tools, routes, or interactions to appear. This allows players to evaluate whether their choices have successfully led to a cleaner, healthier city. While the theme is impactful and the rewind mechanic is innovative, the main challenges was the complexity of tracking and reversing player's states and the additional asset for branching narratives.
